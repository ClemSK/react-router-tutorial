# Learning about react-router-dom@6

I followed the [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfpmvgVZD1A&list=RDCMUCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg&index=1) tutorial to learn about v6 of react-router-dom. The [starter code is here](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/React-Router-Version-6).

The docs for this project can be found in the React Router docs [here](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5).
